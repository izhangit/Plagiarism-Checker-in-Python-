- In this example, first load the stop words from NLTK's corpus. 
- Then define a function jaccard_similarity that takes two sets of tokens and calculates their Jaccard similarity coefficient.
- And also define a function check_plagiarism that takes two texts, tokenizes them, and calculates their similarity score using the jaccard_similarity      function.

- Finally, I demonstrate the usage of the plagiarism checker by providing two sample texts and calling the check_plagiarism function. 
- This will output a similarity score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a perfect match between the two texts.
